# A FORM

### First Design

## What is it?
- This is a little project that I focus in learn new development skills about HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

- Firstly, it is about a simple form like some other. But, over time I wanna change and add code to make it clean.

## Objective
- Learn and improve skills, abilities, libs, dependencies and frameworks.

### Dificulties
- My temporarily superficial knowledge in those tecnologies.
