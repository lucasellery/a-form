# A FORM

## What is it?
- This is a little project that I focus in learn new development skills about HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

## Objective
- Learn and improve skills, abilities, libs, dependencies and frameworks.

### Dificulties
<<<<<<< HEAD
- My temporarily superficial knowledge and those tecnologies.

### Notes

#### The math behind CPF validation
